# INTRODUCTION
___
Instacart is a group of stores based in the United States and Canada where customers can do online shopping using a personal shopper to fulfil and deliver their orders to them that same day. Here is how it works, using the Instacart app or website, the customer can shop for groceries (and more) from a shop near them. When the orders have been placed Instacart connect them to a personal shopper who delivers their orders to them.

This project is aimed at conducting a detailed and structured sales data analysis of Instacart's business using advanced SQL queries, by so doing providing valuable insights and answer useful business questions.
# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
___
The specific objective of this project is to use the provided dataset to unravel Instacart's operational performance customer preferences, product categories and overall financial success over a period of time. To be quite objective, I specifically coined ten business questions and answered them using unique technical SQL queries as highlighted below.
___
# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
I used advanced technical SQL functions to import the dataset into PostgreSQL and did the analysis by imploring queries on the database I created from the dataset.
___
# DATA MODELLING
___
I specifically created a comprehensive database schema using the PostgreSQL to ensure proper organisation, efficiency and effective outcome. I created four specific tables and used the PostgreSQL to develop an ERD for the database making sure I established constraints to ensure the maintenance of data integrity.

# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
From the above analysis, I was able to provide insights to some technical business questions whose answers will help to drive the business forward and generate more financial success. To develop more stategies for business growth other tools could be used to further drill the dataset for specific details. However, from the analysis done so far Instacart can pick out the year which they did so well and try to replicate it to generate as much revenue as they did that year. They could also stock up the products that sell the most and do sales for the least selling products.
